===================

An example gulpfile for Microsoft projects


About
-----

###This project is an example Gulpfile that does the standard 5 CI tasks:

1. clean
2. Version
3. Build
4. Test
5. Deploy

### The sample Microsoft project has a few files that you'll want to replace with your content:

- /GulpTarget.sln
- /Lib
- /Tests
- /Web

### These files are part of the gulp script:

- /Gulpfile.js
- /gulpLib/**
- /package.json: take this or merge the devDependencies into yours

### Running the build:

The build server should have [node](http://nodejs.org) installed and in `PATH`

On each build:

- `npm install`
- `node_mobules\.bin\gulp.cmd` from the root of the project

If each command returns 0, the build succeeded, if any command returns non-zero, the build failed.
Once the build is complete, you'll see the following:

- /log: this is a folder of build logs including MSBuild logs and test logs.
  Collect all files in this directory and publish them as build logs
- /dist: these are deployment assets. Deploy these to necessary servers, and/or collect these in
  the build server as deployment assets.

Note: the test project uses NUnit, and the build file assumes `nunit-console-x86.exe` is in `PATH`
